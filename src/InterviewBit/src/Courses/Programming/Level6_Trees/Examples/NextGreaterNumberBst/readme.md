## Description

Given a BST node, return the node which has value just greater than the given node.

Example:

Given the tree

```text

               100
              /   \
            98    102
           /  \
         96    99
          \
           97
```

Given `97`, you should return the node corresponding to `98` as thats the value just greater than `97` in the tree. If there are no successor in the tree (the value is the largest in the tree, return `NULL`).

Using recursion is not allowed.

Assume that the value is always present in the tree.
