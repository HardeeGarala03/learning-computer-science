## Description

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

Example:

Given s = "the sky is blue",

return "blue is sky the".

A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.
If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
