## Origin

[Link](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/substring-concatenation/)

## Description

You are given a string, S, and a list of words, L, that are all of the same length.

Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once and without any intervening characters.

Example :

```text
S: "barfoothefoobarman"
L: ["foo", "bar"]
```

You should return the indices: [0,9]. Order does not matter.
