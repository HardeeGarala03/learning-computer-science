## Origin

## Description

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in linear time complexity.

Note that when the count of a character C in T is N, then the count of C in minimum window in S should be at least N.

Example :

```text
S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
T = "ABC"
Minimum window is "BANC"
```

Note:

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string ''.

If there are multiple such windows, return the first occurring minimum window ( with minimum start index ).
