## Description

Given n non-negative integers representing the histogramâ€™s bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

![Largest Rectangle in Histogram: Example 1](1.png)

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

![Largest Rectangle in Histogram: Example 2](2.png)

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

For example, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3], return 10.

### Why the i--

When we are in the else branch, means the h (height[i]) is smaller than height[s.peek()], what we do is updating the maxArea, but the height[i] is still waiting to be put into the stack, we do i-- to counteract the i++ statement in the for loop, so that we will get the same i in the next time.
