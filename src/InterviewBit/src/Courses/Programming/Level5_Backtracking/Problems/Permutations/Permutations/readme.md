## Description

Given a collection of numbers, return all possible permutations.

Example:

`[1,2,3]` will have the following permutations:

```text
[1,2,3]
[1,3,2]
[2,1,3]
[2,3,1]
[3,1,2]
[3,2,1]
```

NOTE: No two entries in the permutation sequence should be the same. For the purpose of this problem, assume that all the numbers in the collection are unique.

Warning : DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR GENERATING PERMUTATIONS. Example : next_permutations in C++ / itertools.permutations in python. If you do, we will disqualify your submission retroactively and give you penalty points.
