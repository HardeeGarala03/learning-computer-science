# SQL vs. NoSQL

* SQL - relational database. NoSql - non-relational database.
* Relational databases
  * structures
  * predefined schemas
* Non-relational databases
  * unstructured
  * distributed
  * dynamic schema

## SQL

* Relational databases store data in rows and columns.
* each row contains all information about one entity.
* Columns are separate data points.
* Eg.: MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, SQLite, Postgres, MariaDB, etc.

## NoSQL

Most common types of NoSQL:

### Key-Value Stores

* Data stored in array of key-value pairs.
* Key is an attributed name, which is linked to a value.
* Eg.: Redis, Voldemort, Dynamo.

### Document Databases

* Data is stored in documents instead of rows and columns in a table.
* Documents are grouped together in collections.
* Each document can have an entirely different structure.
* Eg.: CouchDB, MongoDB.

### Wide-Column Databases
